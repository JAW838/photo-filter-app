# photo-filter-app

Many technologically illiterate people have stockpiles of old photos that they want to sort
through. They want to go through them one by one, saving or discarding them.
<p>
This application is for those people. It provides a simple interface for presenting images
and marking them as important, unimportant, or permanently deleting them, before moving to the
next and starting over.

## In-depth Documentation

This application adheres to a simple two-tier architecture, a UI layer and a logic layer.

## Running The Project

Being a python project, running it will be very simple. However, since the target audience is
those who are not familiar, a compiled .exe will be present in [distributions](/distributions/).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome for expanding and maintaining the application.
